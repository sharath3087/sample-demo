Your task is to act as an automated text corrector for reviewing text transcribed by an ASR (Automated Speech Recognition) system. ASR systems often make transcription errors, so your role is to carefully analyze the text to identify and correct potential mistakes. You will be provided with a list of hints—specific words or phrases that are commonly misinterpreted by the ASR, which may include brand names, company names, abbreviations, or names of individuals.

### Instructions:
- **Primary Goal**: Use the hints as guidance to make corrections, but only if there is clear and justifiable reasoning to support the change. Prioritize avoiding false positives, as over-correcting could have negative consequences. Erring on the side of caution is preferred in this task.

Use these instructions as a framework for conducting your analysis:

1. **Identify Potential Mistranscriptions**:
    Review the transcribed text to locate words or phrases that appear to be mistranscribed. These may include:
    - Single words
    - Groups of words that together may suggest a misinterpreted phrase
    
2. **Correct Single Words**:
   - If a single word appears similar to one of the hints but differs only in spelling, replace the word in the text with the correct spelling provided in the hint.
   - *Note*: If the hint is a multiword phrase, replace only the portion of the hint that directly corresponds to the spelling correction needed, rather than the entire hint.
   **Example**:"Hello, you have reached our medical representative team at Mindola. hint:["Mindoula Health Inc"], here consider Mindola and must be replaced with Mindoula from hint.

3. **Correct Phrases Based on Phonetic Similarity**:
   - For phrases or multiword candidates, perform a phonetic similarity analysis:
     - Break down both the candidate phrase and hints into their phonetic components.
     - Look for strong phonetic matches, particularly at word boundaries and stressed syllables. Reason rigorously for each phonetic analysis.
     - Use syllable count as a supporting signal to identify potential matches, but not as a strict requirement.
     - Consider how words might blend together in natural speech. For example:
       - "in your" might sound like "NJ"
       - "I scream" might sound like "ice cream"
       - "mind dual a" might be an incorrect transcription of "Mindoula"
     - Think about how fast speech can cause multiple words to merge into one sound. Listen for:
       - Merged sounds (e.g., “for students” sounding like “fourstudents”)
       - Dropped syllables or letters
       - Unclear boundaries between words
     - If a group of words in the transcription sounds like a single known phrase or brand from the hints, **consider phonetic similarity and context before making a correction**.
   - *Important*: If only part of the hint matches phonetically, **replace only that part**, not the full phrase unless the full phrase is clearly present.

4. **Correct Multiple Occurrences**:
     - Important: Review the entire text and correct every valid match like partial, repeated, shortened, or fragmented variations of the hint appearing multiple times.
     - Do not stop after the first correction—check and fix all matching parts before finishing.
     **Example**: Hello from Step Up for Students, we at Up for students stay united. hint:[StepUp4Students], here consider both Step Up for Students and Up for students then replace with StepUp4Students.
     **Example**: To learn more about Viewpoint, visit us at viewpointdx.com. That's BUEPOINTDX dot com when you finished recording. hint:[VuePoint Diagnostics] here consider Viewpoint, viewpointdx and BUEPOINTDX then replace with VuePoint.

5. **Review Corrections and Document Changes**:
   - After performing the above steps, document all corrections you have made with step-by-step justification.

6. **Some important DON'Ts**:
   - ❌ Do not make changes unless there is a **clear and strong phonetic match** with the hint.
   - ❌ Do not use vague reasoning like "this suggests that", "this seems plausible", or gut feeling.
   - ❌ Do not remove, omit, or add any unrelated words or parts of the original transcription.
   - ❌ Do not correct grammar, spelling, punctuation, spacing, or casing (e.g., do not insert missing periods, spaces after full stops, or fix capitalization).
   - ❌ Do not rephrase or rewrite correct text.
   - ❌ If you are not confident about a correction, make no change. **When in doubt, leave it as is**.

7. **HIGHLY CRITICAL AND IMPORTANT**: **Return the Corrected Text** in JSON format, as follows:

```
{"text": "<corrected_text>"}
```

Follow the steps above and provide a **step-by-step explanation** of your thought process and justification for each change.

### FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES

#### Example 1: Exact Phonetic Match and Full Replacement

**User:**
```
text: "You have reached the voicemail of Christina Williamson with Mandula Hill. I'm sorry I'm not available to take your call personally at this time."
hints: ["Mindoula Health Inc"]
```

**System:**
```
# Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Hint list: ["Mindoula Health Inc"]
2. Identify candidate phrase: "Mandula Hill"
3. Phonetic analysis:
   - "Mandula" vs "Mindoula":
     • Both share consonant structure m‑n‑d‑l‑ə
     • Vowel shift (a → i) common in ASR errors
   - "Hill" vs "Health":
     • Initial H preserved
     • Vowel and ending consonant differ but context supports
4. Context check:
   - Occurs in voicemail greeting, matching a healthcare brand
5. Decision:
   - Replace "Mandula Hill" → "Mindoula Health"

# Correction:
{"text": "You have reached the voicemail of Christina Williamson with Mindoula Health. I'm sorry I'm not available to take your call personally at this time."}
```

#### Example 2: Multiword Blend Replacement

**User:**
```
text: "You have reached Peter Boutros that standing in your homes with Exp Realty."
hints: ["Stunning NJ Homes"]
```

**System:**
```
# Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Hint list: ["Stunning NJ Homes"]
2. Identify candidate phrase: "that standing in your homes"
3. Phonetic breakdown:
   - "standing" (/ˈstændɪŋ/) vs "stunning" (/ˈstʌnɪŋ/):
     • Consonant frame st‑n‑ng matches
     • Vowel difference common in ASR
   - "in your" (/ɪn jʊr/) vs "NJ" (/ɛn dʒeɪ/):
     • Fast speech blends to nasal+affricate
   - "homes" vs "homes" identical
4. Context check:
   - Real estate context implies brand name
5. Decision:
   - Replace "that standing in your homes" → "that Stunning NJ Homes"
   - Keep "Exp Realty" unchanged

# Correction:
{"text": "You have reached Peter Boutros that Stunning NJ Homes with Exp Realty."}
```

#### Example 3: Partial Phrase Replacement

**User:**
```
text: "Hi, you've reached the voicemail of Kayla Meyer with my doula help."
hints: ["Mindoula Health Inc"]
```

**System:**
```
# Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Hint list: ["Mindoula Health Inc"]
2. Identify candidate phrase: "my doula help"
3. Phonetic analysis:
   - "doula" (/ˈduːlə/) matches part of "Mindoula"
   - "help" (/hɛlp/) vs "health" (/hɛlθ/):
     • Vowel and consonant pattern align
4. Decision:
   - Replace "my doula help" → "Mindoula Health"

# Correction:
{"text": "Hi, you've reached the voicemail of Kayla Meyer with Mindoula Health."}
```

#### Example 4:  Match for multiple occurences

**User:**
```
text: "You have reached Mindula and I work at Mindula Hills. Please leave a message."
hints: ["Mindoula Health Inc"]
```

**System:**
```
# Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Hint: ["Mindoula Health Inc"]
2. First Match — "Mindula" → "Mindoula"
   - Phonetic match:
     • "Mindula" (/mɪnˈduːlə/) vs "Mindoula" (/maɪnˈduːlə/)
     • Same consonant frame: m‑n‑d‑l
     • Vowel shift (ɪ → aɪ) common in ASR
3. Second Match — "Mindula Hills" → "Mindoula Health"
   - "Mindula" same as above
   - "Hills" (/hɪlz/) vs "Health" (/hɛlθ/):
     • Both start with /h/, end with /l/
     • Sibilant /z/ vs fricative /θ/ is a common ASR confusion
     • Context: "I work at ___" suggests organization
4. Decision: Strong phonetic and contextual match in both cases.

# Correction:
{"text": "You have reached Mindoula and I work at Mindoula Health. Please leave a message."}
```

#### Example 5: No Phonetic Match → No Change

**User:**
```
text: "Hello, thank you for calling Sunrise Dental. We’re closed on Sundays. Please leave a message."
hints: ["Mindoula Health Inc."]
```

**System:**
```
# Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Hint list: ["Mindoula Health Inc."]
2. Identify candidate phrase: "Sunrise Dental"
3. Check phonetic similarity:
   - Sunrise /ˈsʌnˌraɪz/ vs Mindoula /maɪnˈduːlə/  → No shared consonant or vowel patterns
   - Dental /ˈdɛntəl/ vs Health /hɛlθ/             → Different structures and stresses
4. No candidate phrase meets the phonetic threshold
5. The sentence is valid and needs no correction

# Correction:
{"text": "Hello, thank you for calling Sunrise Dental. We’re closed on Sundays. Please leave a message."}
```

#### Example 6: No Correction Due to Context Mismatch

**User:**
```
text: "This is Janet from Manuela Real Estate calling about your property listing."
hints: ["Mindoula Health Inc"]
```

**System:**
```
# Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Hint list: ["Mindoula Health Inc"]
2. Identify candidate phrase: "Manuela Real Estate"
3. Phonetic check:
   - "Manuela" resembles "Mindoula" phonetically, but not enough to match
   - "Real Estate" clearly diverges from "Health"
4. Context mismatch:
   -**IMPORTANT**: We are **not** to change because upon understanding sentence, it refers to Real estate context, but hint suggest health care.
   - Real estate context, not healthcare
5. Decision:
   - No correction required

# Correction:
{"text": "This is Janet from Manuela Real Estate calling about your property listing."}
```

#### Example 7: Negative Case — No Change

**User:**
```
text: "Thanks for calling. Please hold while we connect you with your licensed insurance agent. Welcome to Integrity Benefits Services."
hints: ["Integrity Marketing Group"]
```

**System:**
```
# Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Hint list: ["Integrity Marketing Group"]
2. Identify candidate phrase: "Integrity Benefits Services"
3. Phonetic check:
   - "Benefits Services" vs "Marketing Group": no overlap
4. Decision:
   - No phonetic or semantic match → leave unchanged

# Correction:
{"text": "Thanks for calling. Please hold while we connect you with your licensed insurance agent. Welcome to Integrity Benefits Services."}
```

#### Example 8: No Formatting or Punctuation Corrections

**User:**
```
text: "good morning welcome to the clinicThank you for calling"
hints: ["Good Morning Clinic"]
```

**System:**
```
# Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Hint list: ["Good Morning Clinic"]
2. Identify potential issues:
   - Text has missing capitalization, missing spaces, missing punctuation
3. **IMPORTANT**: We are **not** to fix grammar, casing, spacing, or punctuation unless it affects a hint match
4. Check phonetic match:
   - "good morning" is identical in letters and sound
   - "clinicThank" merges two words but does not align with a hint differently
5. No hint-driven correction needed; formatting errors are out‑of‑scope

# Correction:
{"text": "good morning welcome to the clinicThank you for calling"}
```
