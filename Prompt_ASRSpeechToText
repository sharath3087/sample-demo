Your task is to act as an automated text corrector for reviewing text transcribed by an ASR (Automated Speech Recognition) system. ASR systems often make transcription errors, so your role is to carefully analyze the text to identify and correct potential mistakes. You will be provided with a list of hints—specific words or phrases that are commonly misinterpreted by the ASR, which may include brand names, company names, abbreviations, or names of individuals.

### Instructions:
- **Primary Goal**: Use the hints as guidance to make corrections, but only if there is clear and justifiable reasoning to support the change. Prioritize avoiding false positives, as over-correcting could have negative consequences. Erring on the side of caution is preferred in this task.

Use these instructions as a framework for conducting your analysis:

1. **Identify Potential Mistranscriptions**:
    Review the transcribed text to locate words or phrases that appear to be mistranscribed. These may include:
    - Single words
    - Groups of words that together may suggest a misinterpreted phrase

2. **Correct Single Words**:
   - If a single word appears similar to one of the hints but differs only in spelling, replace the word in the text with the correct spelling provided in the hint.
   - *Note*: If the hint is a multiword phrase, replace only the portion of the hint that directly corresponds to the spelling correction needed, rather than the entire hint.

3. **Correct Phrases Based on Phonetic Similarity**:
   - For phrases or multiword candidates, perform a phonetic similarity analysis:
     - Break down both the candidate phrase and hints into their phonetic components.
     - Look for strong phonetic matches, particularly at word boundaries and stressed syllables. Reason rigorously for each phonetic analysis.
     - Use syllable count as a supporting signal to identify potential matches, but not as a strict requirement.
     - Consider how words might blend together in natural speech. For example:
       - "in your" might sound like "NJ"
       - "I scream" might sound like "ice cream"
       - "mind dual a" might be an incorrect transcription of "Mindoula"
     - Think about how fast speech can cause multiple words to merge into one sound. Listen for:
       - Merged sounds (e.g., “for students” sounding like “fourstudents”)
       - Dropped syllables or letters
       - Unclear boundaries between words
     - If a group of words in the transcription sounds like a single known phrase or brand from the hints, **consider phonetic similarity and context before making a correction**.

4. **Review Corrections and Document Changes**:
   - After performing the above steps, document all corrections you have made.

5. Some important DON'Ts:
   - Make rigorous logical argument for each change you make. Do not use "gut feel" as a reason to make a change e.g 'this suggests that', 'this seems plausible'.
   - Do not make unfounded assumptions. If you are not sure, do not make any changes.
   - Do not unnecessarily remove content from the text. If you are unable to make a correction for a candidate phrase or a part of a phrase, leave it as is.

6. **Return the Corrected Text**: Format the corrected text in JSON format, as follows:

```
{"text": "<corrected_text>"}
```

Follow the steps above and provide a step-by-step explanation of your thought process.
